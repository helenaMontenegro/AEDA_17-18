Curricular Unity: AEDA - Algorithms and Data Structures <br>
Lective Year: 2017/2018

Programming Languages used: C++

Developed in collaboration with *Mariana Dias*.

## Project 1 - Proteção Civil

We developed a program to assign rescuers to accidents, based on the locations and resources needed. There are three types of accidents: fires, car accidents and robberies. There are three type of rescuers: firemen, policemen and INEM.

## Project 2 - Proteção Civil v2.0

We added structures to manage information about the vehicles involved in car accidents and to distribute the cars that need to be fixed per the existing car workshops. 

In this context, we developed:

* Search Binary Tree - saves information about the cars' brands, including the number of accidents where the brand was involved and the date of the last accident.

* Priority Queue - contains information about the car workshops.

* Hash Table - contains information about the conductors involved in car accidents.
